INSTALLATION

npm init : package.json & package-lock.json
npm install express : node_modules 

Installing development dependencies : typescript
npm install typescript ts-node ,which will allow us to run our typescript application
also were gonna install the nodemon in order to allow us to watch ourfiles and restart the server every time we're going to do changes 

npm install typescript ts-node nodemon @types/node @types/express

Command to run the code .
npx ts-node src/index.ts

Now our server is ready to receive requests 

package.json 
lets define a script that will watch our files and restart every time we do a change.
"dev" : "nodemon src/index.ts"
so now if i stop the server that was run with npx node and now if i do npm run dev so now nodemon will execute the file ,we are still going to be able to restart the server.

.gitignore file
since anyone can install node modules on their end ,so we there is no need to upload node_modules
in github ,so in .gitignore file simply specify the modules that you dont want to upload in github

Adding file in Github
1. git init
2. git status
